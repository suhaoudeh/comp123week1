<p>
Since 1972, IUCN is the official advisor on nature under the World Heritage Convention. 
The Convention is known as "the most widely accepted international conservation treaty in human history”, 
ratified today by 195 States Parties. Natural World Heritage sites conserve the planet’s most significant ecosystems, 
species, and natural phenomena – from the highest mountain peaks, through forests, deserts, wetlands and reefs. 
Despite their iconic status, World Heritage is facing a funding crisis for many years and sites are 
not immune to growing threats from biodiversity loss, climate change and pollution. Learn more about what IUCN is doing to address this and how you can take part.
