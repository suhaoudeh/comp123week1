 <h1>Heritage and Its Importance in Today’s World</h1>
    <p>
        Heritage represents the legacy of physical artifacts and intangible attributes passed down from previous generations. 
        It includes cultural traditions, historic buildings, monuments, and natural landscapes that define the identity of a people or place. 
        In today’s rapidly changing world, heritage serves as a bridge to the past, offering insight into the values, beliefs, and practices 
        that shaped societies. It fosters a sense of belonging, continuity, and understanding, helping individuals and communities connect to 
        their roots. Protecting and preserving heritage is crucial not only for honoring history but also for promoting diversity, education, 
        and sustainable development for future generations.
